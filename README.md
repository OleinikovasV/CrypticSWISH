# SWISH
Scripts that are helpful to setup SWISH [1] simulations.
Documentation to be added soon!

Scripts have been rewritten to rely on ParmEd (https://github.com/ParmEd/ParmEd) for better transferabilty and extensibility. Have been tested using Amber type force-fields, with AMBER and GROMACS MD engines, a little bit of OpenMM, too.
 
1. Prepare topologies for water-apolar interface scaling
2. Add fragments and adjust interligand repulsion (optional)
3. Other useful scripts for analysis (TBA)

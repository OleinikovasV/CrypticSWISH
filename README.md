# SWISH
Scripts that are helpful to setup [SWISH](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.6b05425) simulations.
Documentation to be added!

Scripts have been rewritten to rely on [ParmEd](https://github.com/ParmEd/ParmEd) for better transferabilty and extensibility. Have been tested using Amber type force-fields, with AMBER and GROMACS MD engines, a little bit of OpenMM, too.
 
1. Prepare topologies for water-apolar interface scaling
2. Add fragments and adjust interligand repulsion (optional)
3. Other useful scripts for analysis (TBA)

N.B. Consider all scripts under development. Please, inform of any issues. Thank you!

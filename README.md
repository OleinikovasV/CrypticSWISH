# SWISH
Scripts that are helpful to setup SWISH [1] simulations.

Scripts have been rewritten to rely on ParmEd (https://www.parmed.com) for better transferabilty and extensibility. Have been tested heavily using AMBER and GROMACS, a little bit of OpenMM, too.
 
1. Prepare topologies for water-apolar interface scaling
2. Add fragments and adjust interligand repulsion (optional)
3. Other useful scripts for analysis (TBA)
